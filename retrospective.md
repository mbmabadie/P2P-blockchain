## Organization of Work and Technology
We wrote our code in Python and used Github for version control. We had regular meetings to update each other, discuss challenges, and assign new tasks.
One half of our group worked on the peer/tracker aspects of the network and the other half worked on the encryption, transactions, and blockchain aspects.e

## Difficulties We Faced <br />
This strict division of labor caused problems because when we met later in the semester, we realized our approaches to each part of the project were not as compatible as we would have liked. This made us re-arrange our project and code more than we wanted to or planned for. <br />
Implementing a P2P network from scratch without external libraries was more difficult than we expected. Multithreading was problematic because it made sharing data more complicated. 

## Lessons We Learned <br />
- We learned how to implement a P2P network
- Solidified our understanding of the difference between P2P networks and client-server networks
- Data encryption/decryption
- Multithreading

## What would we keep for next time
- Tracker 
- Cheese chain

## What would we do differently
- Read the project documentation earlier and understand better what our priorities should be. This would lead to a more effective use of time.
- Start the project as soon as it was assigned

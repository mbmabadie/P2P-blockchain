## What works
We successfully implemented a Peer-to-Peer network where users can communicate, send, and receive information across the network. Users can also mine for cheese by generating and search for a cheese smell. 

## What does not work

## Our results compared to our objectives
Our main goal was to implement a working Peer-to-Peer network which we achieved. We then wanted to create a functioning mining process where peers could act as miners. Finally, we wanted to incorporate transactions which would have been stored in our cheese. We did generate transactions with public and private keys but we did not have enough time to integrate that part into our blockchain.

## Workload
40 hours each

## Member responsibility
Badia and Mostafa - encrypting transactions, cheese, chain, private and public keys <br />
Sina - tracker, peer, cheesechain <br />
Ronnie - peer, transactions <br />
Souhail - cheese, cheese chain, peer <br />

## Good Development Practices

# Documents
All documents are in .md. We followed this part well.

# Git
We used .gitignore since we all used different IDEs. We all wrote descriptive git update messages in English. <br />
We only pushed working code onto the main branch and used other branchs for testing purposes. Some of us pair-programmed, but we forgot to attribute all coders in the update messages.

# Code
All the code is written in English and properly formatted. All the functions have descriptive names. We used global variables because we needed to share data among threads but this proved to be problematic. We spent a lot of time debugging errors caused by global variables. We ultimately overcame these issues.

# Testing
We tested our code as we came across errors but we did not maintain a unit test folder. We wrote documentation to run and maintain the network.
